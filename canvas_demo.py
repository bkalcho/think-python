# 1. Write a program that creates a Canvas and a Button. When the user
# presses the Button, it should draw a circle on the canvas.
# 2. Modify your solution to Exercise 19.2 by adding an Entry widget and
# a second button. When the user presses the second button, it should
# read a color name from the Entry and use it to change the fill color
# of the circle. Use config to modify the existing circle; donâ€™t create
# a new one.
# Your program should handle the case where the user tries to change the
# color of a circle that hasn't been created, and the case where the
# color name is invalid.
